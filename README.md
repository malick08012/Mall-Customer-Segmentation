# Mall-Customer-Segmentation
This project applies unsupervised machine learning techniques to perform customer segmentation using the K-Means clustering algorithm. We use the well-known Mall Customers Dataset, which contains information about customers such as Customer ID, Gender, Age, Annual Income (k$), and Spending Score (1-100). The main objective is to group customers into distinct clusters based on their purchasing behavior and income levelsâ€”insights that can be valuable for business marketing strategies and personalized services.

Key Steps:
Preprocessing & scaling

Elbow Method for optimal clusters

K-Means clustering

Cluster visualization using PCA

Cluster interpretation

Tools:
Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
